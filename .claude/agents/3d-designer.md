Run the `3d-designer` skill exactly. The commission in `job_state.md` defines whether you
are building the blind mating reference or a candidate part. Do not change contract files,
accept your own design, update the queue, or dispatch other agents. Use only the commissioned
backend and write only inside the assigned design folder. Never access photos during a blind
reference commission.

Weld STL parts into ONE **Bambu Studio project 3MF** with print settings and
per-part filament assignment already baked in, so opening it in Bambu Studio is
"import -> eyeball -> slice" with nothing to configure by hand.

    python make_feeder_3mf.py out.3mf "drip_barrel=stl/drip_barrel.stl" ...

Part-name -> filament rule (the whole point of this script; see PART_RULES):
    name contains "Base"  ->  filament 1, Bambu PETG Translucent, MAIN nozzle
    name contains "Text"  ->  filament 2, Bambu PETG-CF,          AUX  nozzle

Why this exists at all: the plain 3MF core spec (what skills/3d-modeling/scripts/
make_3mf.py writes) carries geometry and nothing else. Bambu Studio imports it as
one object with N selectable parts, but every part lands on filament 1 and the
process preset is whatever was last used. On a dual-nozzle X2D with a translucent
part that must be 100% infill, that is four separate hand-edits, each easy to get
wrong and invisible until the print fails. See references/bambu-3mf-authoring.md
for the concepts (project_settings.config vs model_settings.config, the slicer
round-trip, the three traps, and the honesty rule) this script implements.

ADAPTING TO ANOTHER MACHINE/PRINTER: every preset name, profile id, extruder
map, and pinned value below is X2D-specific and was read out of THIS machine's
*installed* Bambu Studio profile tree (BBL system bundle) - names from a newer
machine like the X2D do NOT transfer from H2D/older machines. To retarget:
re-run the round-trip in references/bambu-3mf-authoring.md (configure a plate for
the new machine in Bambu Studio, Save Project As, unzip, diff two saves) to learn
that machine's profile ids and key names/values, then update PRINTER_PRESET /
PROCESS_PRESET / FILAMENT_PRESETS / PART_RULES / the per-variant + fixup tables
here. Never guess keys; verify() proves internal consistency only, not that the
slicer accepts the file.

Requires: trimesh, numpy (mesh load), lxml (verification). Reads - never writes -
the installed Bambu Studio profile tree.

# 02.07.01.62 for this X2D. Everything this script emits was diffed against it -

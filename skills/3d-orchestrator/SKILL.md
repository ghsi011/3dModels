# 3D Orchestrator

## Charter

Own routing, job state, phase gates, user questions, specialist dispatch, project/queue
housekeeping, and delivery. Never write or edit geometric source, STL, STEP, or 3MF content.
Specialists communicate through project files and source photos only, never chat summaries.

## Inputs and outputs

- Inputs: the user request, photos and measurements, repository state, printer constraints,
  and every current contract artifact in the project folder.
- Write: `job_state.md` using the exact schema in
  [`../team-design.md`](../team-design.md#job-statemd).
- Read and gate: `dimensions.md`, `print_plan.md`, `candidate_readiness.md`,
  `verification_report.md`, designer outputs, `final_print_prep.md`, and conditional
  `final_prep_review.md`.
- Housekeeping: the Notion Print Queue entry and physical-change git commits required by
  repository policy.
- Never substitute a chat summary for a contract. Before every dispatch, tell the agent to
  read the named files from disk.

## Required reading

1. [`../3d-modeling/references/team-contracts-v4.md`](../3d-modeling/references/team-contracts-v4.md).
2. For a solo job only, read and run [`../3d-modeling/SKILL.md`](../3d-modeling/SKILL.md)
   unchanged.

## Consequence and escalation gate

Before any solo-vs-pipeline routing decision, classify every job into exactly one consequence
class and record the class, rationale, reviewer requirement, and prohibited claims in
`job_state.md`'s `## Route` section (an optional `risk_class` field on the JSON mirror carries
the same enum value when present, for `team_tools` to check mechanically; its absence is valid).
Classification is a judgment call informed by the actual request, not a keyword match — when
genuinely uncertain between two classes, classify toward the higher-consequence one. Re-classify
immediately if new information raises the class (e.g. "for my desk" becomes "goes on my bike's
brake lever").

- **`R0_DECORATIVE`** — cosmetic/display only; no functional load; failure only disappoints.
- **`R1_LOW_CONSEQUENCE`** — light functional use; failure causes inconvenience or wasted
  material, never injury.
- **`R2_ENGINEERING_REVIEW`** — sustained load, repeated/cyclic motion, elevated temperature,
  vehicle-mounted, magnets near children, electrical enclosure, food contact, fluid
  containment, or any other injury-capable failure mode. Requires a **named human reviewer**, a
  documented test plan, a conservative (fail-safe, not fail-dangerous) failure mode, and
  physical proof (a printed and tested part, not a render) before the pipeline may make any
  "ready for use" claim. The pipeline may design and gather evidence but does not itself
  certify the part safe — that is the named reviewer's call.
- **`R3_PROHIBITED_AUTONOMOUS_ACCEPTANCE`** — life-safety, medical, pressure vessel,
  load-bearing for a person, braking/steering, a mains-electrical barrier, fire containment, a
  weapon, or regulated structural application. The pipeline may give conceptual/non-operational
  help only (discussion, non-functional mockups, pointers to the relevant professional or
  regulatory process) and must **never** mark such a job accepted, verified, safe, or
  ready-to-use — regardless of what any gate, checklist, or verification report reports. No
  dispatch in this pipeline may output an acceptance verdict for an `R3` job; treat any contract
  that tries to (e.g. a `verification_report.md` with `status: PASS`) as invalid for that reason
  alone.

`R2`/`R3` are independent of `COMPACT`/`FULL` and of solo/pipeline mode — a decorative multi-part
job can stay `COMPACT`/pipeline-for-fit-reasons while an `R2` single bracket still needs the
reviewer gate.

## Checklist

1. Run the Consequence and escalation gate above and record the resulting class, rationale,
   reviewer requirement, and prohibited claims in `job_state.md` before any routing decision.
2. Create the project folder and compact `job_state.md`; create/update the Print Queue
   entry. Use `COMPACT` unless multi-part/moving/high-consequence work requires `FULL`.
3. Route to **solo** only when the part is simple, single-part, non-fit-critical, has no
   recreated mating geometry, does not merit independent visual verification, and is `R0` or
   `R1`. Never route an `R2` or `R3` job to solo.
4. Route to **pipeline** when any condition holds: fit or datum criticality, recreated
   geometry from photos, multiple parts, mating or moving interfaces, safety/thermal/load
   consequences, multi-colour alignment, difficult DFM, user-requested team/fresh review, or
   the job is `R2`/`R3`. An `R2` job additionally needs the named reviewer and test plan
   recorded before any "ready for use" claim; an `R3` job is restricted to conceptual/
   non-operational help and is never marked accepted by this pipeline regardless of what
   downstream gates report.
5. In pipeline mode, advance only through:
   `INTAKE -> METROLOGY -> REFERENCE_BUILD -> REFERENCE_ACCEPTANCE -> PRINT_PLAN ->
   CANDIDATE_BUILD -> INDEPENDENT_VERIFICATION -> PRINT_PREP ->
   [FINAL_PREP_REVIEW when required] -> DELIVERY`.
6. Dispatch the metrologist to create `dimensions.md`; gate on complete datum/provenance,
   confidence grades, resolved blockers, and one blind-build-completeness row for every
   visible feature before spending a reference build.
7. Dispatch one designer with the **reference** commission. Then dispatch the metrologist
   again to overlay-accept it. A failure returns to `METROLOGY`: fix the sheet, not the
   reference model.
8. Dispatch the print engineer for the pre-design `print_plan.md`; gate on orientation,
   material, nozzle-linked limits, support budget, chamfers, colour constraints, a complete
   per-interface fit-strategy declaration, and a frozen `required_now` / `deferred_owner` /
   `final_gate` scope for every geometry rule.
9. Dispatch candidate designer(s) against the sheet, accepted reference, and print plan.
   Require a hash-bound `candidate_readiness.md` with `status: READY` from the exported STL
   before verifier dispatch, including complete edge/comfort and support-sensitivity
   preflight tables. Independently rerun the v4 `validate-receipts` command and gate on its
   zero exit plus `PASS`; matching Markdown prose is insufficient. `NOT_READY` remains inside
   the same designer commission. Only CadQuery candidates may run in parallel. Serialize all
   FreeCAD work through one instance.
10. Dispatch a fresh verifier that was never a designer and has no candidate-author history.
    Treat designer readiness as untrusted and require all seven checks. A `REJECT` returns to
    `CANDIDATE_BUILD` with the concrete defect list; never ask the verifier to fix it. For an
    `R2` job, a `PASS` is not itself the "ready for use" claim — that still needs the named
    reviewer's sign-off and physical proof. For an `R3` job, the verifier must never issue
    `PASS`/accepted at all.
11. After candidate `PASS`, dispatch the print engineer for coupon, slicing, print order,
    and field-test details in `final_print_prep.md`. A support-free plan with no deferred
    visual predicate may finish `COMPLETE`. When the plan relies on support contacts,
    toolpaths, or another slicer-dependent visual predicate, require `READY_FOR_REVIEW` and
    dispatch the verifier to write `final_prep_review.md` before delivery.
12. Enforce the plan-revision rule in the shared v3 contract. Any changed candidate
    predicate requires a new readiness receipt and a new fresh full seven-check verifier;
    adding only bound P2 evidence does not.
13. If plan-required native slicer evidence cannot be produced, stop at
    `BLOCKED_NATIVE_SLICER` with hashes and the missing capability. Never label it Ready to
    Print. A non-native exception requires explicit user approval.
14. Deliver only when the exported/re-imported artifacts pass all gates, final print prep is
    `COMPLETE` or has `FINAL_PRINT_PASS`, the queue is current, and the meaningful physical
    iteration is committed. For `R2`, deliver only after the named reviewer's sign-off and
    physical proof are recorded. For `R3`, this pipeline never reaches `DELIVERY`.
15. Advance from a commission as soon as its required file receipt is complete and valid;
    do not wait for a chat summary. Record a realistic minute budget per dispatch and ask
    for an exact blocker when it expires.
16. Keep evidence differential. Never copy a canonical STL into a verifier folder. Preserve
    hashes, reports, metrics, and the decisive defect visual; do not fan out unchanged exports
    or full render sets per rejection.

If this skill is loaded inside an agent runtime that cannot spawn nested subagents, keep the
orchestrator in the main session (or launch it as a top-level agent) and dispatch specialists
from there.

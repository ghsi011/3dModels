# Team pipeline runtime contracts v4

**Normative status: this file is the sole normative runtime contract and gate schema for the
five-role pipeline.** `skills/team-design.md` is architecture rationale, historical templates,
and migration history; where it conflicts with this file, this file governs. Do not build a
new runtime contract from a `team-design.md` "Exact template" section — use the schemas below.

This is the compact runtime schema for the five-role pipeline. It preserves the semantic
fields and gates in `skills/team-design.md` while avoiding rereading the full architecture
document on every commission.

Rules:

- Tables may add rows but may not remove columns.
- Every contract uses millimetres unless a row says otherwise.
- `A` = direct measurement, `B` = authoritative/corroborated, `C` = image-derived,
  `D` = assumption.
- Hashes bind agents to files. Chat is never a contract.
- Compact means fewer repeated words and images, not fewer datums, sources, checks, or
  uncertainties.

Use `COMPACT` for a single candidate and one uncomplicated mating envelope. Use `FULL` for
multi-part/moving mechanisms, safety/load consequences, several independent interfaces,
multi-colour alignment, or parallel candidates. Both profiles run the same gates.

`job_state.md`'s `## Route` section also records the job's consequence/risk class from the
orchestrator's Consequence and escalation gate (`R0_DECORATIVE` / `R1_LOW_CONSEQUENCE` /
`R2_ENGINEERING_REVIEW` / `R3_PROHIBITED_AUTONOMOUS_ACCEPTANCE`; see
[`../../3d-orchestrator/SKILL.md`](../../3d-orchestrator/SKILL.md)), its rationale, any named
human reviewer requirement, and the claims the pipeline is prohibited from making for that
class. An optional `risk_class` field on the JSON mirror carries the same enum when present;
its absence is valid (backward-compatible) and only the Markdown/JSON `## Route` record is
required.

Every visible feature must appear in blind-build completeness. A cosmetic feature may use a
visual/bounded envelope, but cannot be omitted. Camera, control, connector, protective-lip,
handed, load, and clearance features are functional.

A mating/fit-relevant dimension records **as-observed geometry and its measurement
uncertainty** (instrument resolution, repeat-read spread, near-feature bias) — not a fit class,
clearance band, or interference allowance. Fit strategy (clearance, transition, interference,
intended contact, and their bounds) is owned by `print_plan.md`, not this sheet; see that
section for the per-interface declaration and the "bounded band, not a floor" principle it
inherits.

# Print plan

## Model-to-printer transform
| Item | Exact value |
|---|---|
| Transform/rotation | <matrix or ordered rotations> |
| Bed-contact landmark | <named face/datum> |
| Bed normal | <vector> |
| Open/insertion direction | <vector> |

## Geometry rules and phase scope
| ID | Rule | Numeric limit | Verification predicate | required_now | deferred_owner | final_gate |

|---|---|---|---:|---|---|---|---|

## Coupon

|---|---|---|---|

## Final-prep placeholders
<slicer/profile, order, inspection, field test>
```

The transform is a design input, not prose. Prefer one multi-lane coupon STL. Add separate
coupon files only when disjoint interfaces cannot be tested together.

Every geometry rule freezes what must be proved before candidate verification and what, if
anything, is deferred:

- `required_now` names the exact candidate/readiness and verifier evidence required in the
  current phase.
- `deferred_owner` is `none` or one later owner with concrete artifact names.
- `final_gate` is `none` or the exact later state blocked until those artifacts are reviewed.
- An accepted plan revision may not move a failed or omitted `required_now` predicate to a
  later owner for the same candidate hash.

Classify every transformed downface, bridge, roof, or layer-transition predicate as
`SELF_SUPPORT_REQUIRED` or `SUPPORT_ALLOWED`. `SELF_SUPPORT_REQUIRED` requires a zero
out-of-limit result in both readiness and check 7. `SUPPORT_ALLOWED` requires a named mesh
region, exact transform/nozzle/line-width/layer range, quantified footprint or interval,
one permitted nonfunctional contact class, enumerated forbidden faces, and named post-print
artifacts. No unplanned region may become support-allowed after it fails verification.

Support-free is the **default, not a hard constraint.** Do not classify a face
`SELF_SUPPORT_REQUIRED` when meeting it forces a *functional* surface (a mating wall, fit
face, bearing/grip surface, or the snug cavity itself) into a distorting gable, steep taper,
or over-wide cavity — that trades a real functional defect for support-purity. Where a
support-free orientation would compromise function or fit, the print engineer plans a bounded
`SUPPORT_ALLOWED` on a *nonfunctional* region instead. Zero-support absolutism is reserved for
parts where it costs nothing functional.

The print engineer owns fit strategy and declares it per interface. Every mating/contact
interface gets an ID and a full declaration: fit type (`clearance`, `transition`,
`interference`, intended elastic contact, crush rib, snap engagement, retention, seal, thread,
or compliant mechanism), intended contact state, an explicit per-side min **and** max range,
motion path (`none` for a fixed interface), material assumptions, a coupon/calibration
requirement, and a numeric/physical acceptance method. **No universal zero-interference rule**:
an interference, crush-rib, snap, or retention interface may declare a deliberately negative
(intersecting) range; a `clearance` interface must stay non-negative on both sides. A
fit-driving range is a **bounded band, not a floor** — over-clearance (slop, wobble, a captured
part that slips or rattles) fails the fit exactly as interference does. Do not carry a
one-sided "≥X, designer may increase" into the plan — that is what produces loose, rattly parts
that pass every gate.

The print engineer also writes `print_plan_checks.json` with every Edge ID, support rule, and
declared interface. This file is the machine-readable projection of the accepted Markdown plan,
not a second source of requirements:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 4,
  "candidate_predicate_revision": 1,
  "edges": [
    {
      "id": "E-01",
      "min_radius_mm": 0.4,
      "max_radius_mm": null,
      "samples_required": 3
    }
  ],
  "support_rules": [
    {
      "id": "S-01",
      "disposition": "SELF_SUPPORT_REQUIRED",
      "model_to_printer_matrix": [[1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1]],
      "bed_z_mm": 0,
      "bed_tolerance_mm": 0.05,
      "downward_normal_z_max": -0.70710678,
      "max_out_of_limit_area_mm2": 0
    }
  ],
  "interfaces": [
    {
      "id": "I-01",
      "fit_type": "clearance",
      "contact_state": "sliding, user-operated",
      "min_mm": 0.15,
      "max_mm": 0.30,
      "motion_path": "insert along -Z, 12 mm travel",
      "material": "PETG on PETG",
      "coupon_required": true,
      "acceptance_method": "gauge-pin pass/fail per lane"
    }
  ]
}
```

Use `allowed_sharp: true` only with `allowed_sharp_reason`. A `SUPPORT_ALLOWED` row also
names `allowed_contact_class` and forbidden faces in the Markdown plan. The print engineer
must make the Edge ID, support-rule ID, and interface ID sets complete before candidate CAD.

`interfaces` is optional for backward compatibility — a plan with no mating/contact interfaces
may omit it, and `team_preflight.py validate-interfaces` skips validation when the key is
absent. When present, every entry is fully validated: `id` (unique string), `fit_type` (one of
`clearance`, `transition`, `interference`, `elastic_contact`, `crush_rib`, `snap`, `retention`,
`seal`, `thread`, `compliant`), `contact_state` (string), finite `min_mm`/`max_mm` with
`max_mm >= min_mm` (a `clearance` interface additionally requires both `>= 0`; every other fit
type may declare a negative, intersecting range), `motion_path` (string), `material` (string),
`acceptance_method` (string), and `coupon_required` (bool). A malformed entry fails validation
with a field/ID-named error; see
[`../scripts/team_preflight.py`](../scripts/team_preflight.py).

## `candidate_readiness.md`

This is designer-owned dispatch evidence. It is never acceptance and never substitutes for
fresh verification.

# Candidate readiness — DESIGNER SELF-CHECK, NON-ACCEPTANCE

| One watertight intended body and bounds | yes | | | |
| Seated interference | plan threshold | | | |

|---|---|

## Commands and hashes
<reproducible commands and output paths>
```

The orchestrator recomputes presence and hashes. `NOT_READY` stays inside the same designer
commission until corrected; no verifier is dispatched.

The designer also writes `candidate_preflight.json`, one shared support-audit JSON per
support rule, `candidate_preflight_validation.json`, and `artifact_manifest.json` (see below)
covering every produced STL/STEP/render artifact. It must run:

```text
python skills/3d-modeling/scripts/team_preflight.py support-audit \
  --stl <candidate.stl> --plan print_plan_checks.json --rule-id <S-ID> \
  --output <S-ID>-support-audit.json

python skills/3d-modeling/scripts/team_preflight.py validate-receipts \
  --stl <candidate.stl> --plan print_plan_checks.json \
  --readiness candidate_preflight.json \
  --output candidate_preflight_validation.json
```

`support-audit` (subcommand name kept for backward compatibility; its result `kind` is
`downward-facing-surface-screen`) is a **conservative downward-facing-surface orientation
screen** — it measures transformed non-bed-contact area whose normal faces down past a
threshold. It does **not** prove slicer supportability, bridgeability, or print success; a
face it flags as within limits can still fail to print cleanly, and slicer behavior (support
generation, bridging, interface layers) is not modeled. Treat a PASS as necessary geometric
evidence for the agent's supportability judgment, never as that judgment itself.

`candidate_preflight.json` binds the STL and plan-check hashes, contains exactly every plan
Edge ID with numeric `samples_mm`, method, and evidence, and exactly every support-rule ID
with its shared audit path. The validator must exit zero and report `PASS` before Markdown
readiness may say `READY`. After any correction, rerun the full Edge ID and support-rule
sets, not only the last reported defect.

Give every opening boundary, protective lip, exterior user-touch boundary, removal/grip edge,
and plan-named exposed edge an Edge ID. Classify it as `EXPOSED_FUNCTIONAL`,
`EXPOSED_COMFORT`, `HIDDEN`, `BED_CONTACT`, or `PERMITTED_SUPPORT_CONTACT`. An exposed edge
may remain sharp only with a feature-specific plan reason and allowed-sharp condition.
Otherwise sample the re-imported STL at both endpoints and one interior point. A nominal
0.40 mm round must measure 0.38–0.42 mm at every sample. Source fillets, renders, and global
sharp-edge counts are not measurements. These checks are dispatch preflight only; the fresh
verifier independently repeats the applicable sections.

## `artifact_manifest.json`

Every commission that produces exported geometry (reference or candidate) also writes
`artifact_manifest.json`: a **required candidate output**, machine-authoritative, no Markdown
mirror. `contract_version: 1` (independent of the Markdown contracts' `contract_version: 4`).
Owned by whichever commission produced the artifacts (the designer, for reference/candidate
STL/STEP/renders); the orchestrator and verifier read and gate on it, never author it.

Required top-level fields: `contract: artifact-manifest`, `contract_version: 1`, `job_id`,
`candidate_id`, `units` (declared unit; currently only `mm`), `updated_utc`, and an `artifacts`
list. Each artifact row: `id`, `role` (`reference | candidate | coupon | render | source |
mating_reference | other`), `path` (project-relative), `type` (`stl | step | svg | png | md |
json | py | 3mf`), `sha256` (recomputed from the file's bytes, never the agent-entered value),
and optionally `expected_components`, `bbox` (`{"min": [x,y,z], "max": [x,y,z]}`),
`source_revisions`, `transform`, `printable_deliverable`, and `paired_artifact_id` (an STL
paired with its STEP twin, for the bbox cross-check below).

Validation is already implemented in
[`../scripts/team_tools/`](../scripts/team_tools/) — run
`python -m team_tools.contracts validate <project-dir>` from `skills/3d-modeling/scripts/`.
It checks: artifact file exists; declared hash matches the recomputed one; bbox is finite with
positive extent on every axis; declared `expected_components` matches the re-imported STL's
observed connected-component count; a `mating_reference` artifact can never be marked
`printable_deliverable`; and artifact IDs are unique. **Unit/scale validation is a hard gate,
not advisory:** the declared bbox extent is compared against the re-imported STL's actual
extent, and an obvious 25.4x (inch/mm) ratio mismatch (within 0.5% of an exact ratio) is a hard
`UNIT_SCALE_MISMATCH` validation error; a looser match (within 3%) downgrades to a
`POSSIBLE_UNIT_SCALE_MISMATCH` warning instead of blocking. When a `paired_artifact_id` links an
STL to a STEP artifact and both load, their bounding-box extents are cross-checked the same way
(`STL_STEP_BBOX_MISMATCH`). STEP handling stays intentionally shallow: STEP loading is
opportunistic and skipped, never failed, when no OCC/cascadio backend is installed — there is no
deep STEP topology compare. STL bbox plus declared units is the load-bearing check.

The verifier treats a failed `python -m team_tools.contracts validate` (non-zero exit) as a hard
reject of the candidate's exported artifacts, distinct from the seven geometric checks. In
particular, any `UNIT_SCALE_MISMATCH` is a hard `UNIT_SCALE` reject — never downgrade it to a
note-and-pass — recorded as a defect owned by `CANDIDATE_BUILD`.

# Independent verification

## Input/upstream audit
| Input/claim | Expected revision/hash/datum | Independent observation | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## Seven checks on re-imported exported STL
| Check | Method | Numeric result | Visual observation | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|
| 1 interference | | | | | |
| 2 full insertion/travel sweep | | | | | |
| 3 section | | | | | |
| 4 same-view/photo overlay look | | n/a | | | |
| 5 named-datum feature positions/handedness | | | | | |
| 6 measurement-to-geometry audit | | | | | |
| 7 planned-orientation printability/faces | | | | | |

## Defects
| ID | Owning loop | Feature/check IDs | Expected vs observed | Evidence | Required acceptance condition |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Verdict
<PASS, or REJECT to METROLOGY / PRINT_PLAN / CANDIDATE_BUILD>
```

The verifier treats `candidate_readiness.md` as untrusted completeness evidence and reruns
all seven checks. Every changed STL hash requires a new fresh verifier context.

The verifier also independently repeats declared edge sections in check 6. In check 7 it
recomputes every `SELF_SUPPORT_REQUIRED` predicate and every `SUPPORT_ALLOWED`
footprint/classification. Visual inspection, not an isometric scalar claim, establishes
whether a support contact class is plausible.

The verifier reruns `team_preflight.py support-audit` into verifier-owned JSON for every
support rule and independently checks that its edge evidence covers the exact plan Edge ID
set. Shared code standardizes the geometric predicate; a fresh context, fresh execution,
fresh visual inspection, and independent measurements preserve verifier independence.

Do not copy the canonical candidate STL into verifier folders. Re-import it in place and
record its hash. A rejected run retains its report, metrics, the defect-specific visual, and
source/output hashes; it does not duplicate unchanged full render sets or exports. A passing
run retains the canonical full report and only verifier-owned visuals that add evidence.

## Plan-revision rule

A plan revision requires a new candidate-readiness receipt and a new fresh full seven-check
verification, even for the same STL hash, when it changes transform, bed landmark, open
direction, material, nozzle, layer or line width, shrink/clearance, walls, overhangs,
bridges, edge/comfort rules, loads, colour, support disposition, permitted contact class,
forbidden faces, or any acceptance threshold/evidence scope. A revision that only adds
post-verification artifacts under an unchanged bound plan requires the applicable final-prep
review, not seven checks. Metadata or coupon elaboration that changes no candidate predicate
requires neither. A failed `required_now` predicate can never be downgraded to deferred.

## `final_print_prep.md`

This is print-engineer-owned manufacturing evidence. Candidate `PASS` is not permission to
claim this receipt is complete.

# Final print preparation

| Required P2 item | Plan rule/final gate | Observed artifact/hash | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Coupon source/export and pass/fail lanes | | | |
| Slicer/profile or reproducible settings | | | |
| Underside support-contact view, when required | | | |

| Layer/contact map per support footprint, when required | | | |
| Transform/profile/nozzle/material match | | | |
| Print order, inspection, and field-test protocol | | | |
```

Use `COMPLETE` only when every plan-deferred item is satisfied and none requires independent
visual contact/toolpath review. Use `READY_FOR_REVIEW` when the plan relies on
`SUPPORT_ALLOWED` or another slicer-dependent visual predicate; the verifier then writes
`final_prep_review.md`. Support-free parts with zero out-of-limit regions need concrete
slicer settings and a coupon, but not a native project solely for ceremony.

## `final_prep_review.md`

| Deferred plan predicate | Independent visual/numeric observation | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
```

This review does not rerun all seven candidate checks unless the STL or a candidate predicate
changed. It inspects actual support contacts, toolpaths, and layer maps against the unchanged
accepted plan. Missing coverage, forbidden/exposed-edge contact, or an unmapped footprint
rejects final prep.

If a plan-required native slicer cannot launch, import the candidate, save its project, or
show contacts/toolpaths, write `BLOCKED_NATIVE_SLICER` with command/version, candidate and
plan hashes, missing capability, and required owner action. Do not claim native proof or
Ready to Print. A reproducible portable fallback may be labelled `NON_NATIVE`, but it remains
`FINAL_PRINT_BLOCKED` unless the user explicitly approves that exception.

## 1. Printability rules

- Overhangs ≤ 45° from vertical always print clean; well-cooled modern machines manage
  50–60° in PLA. Design to 45, accept 50 when unavoidable.
- Bridges (one rule, cited elsewhere): ≤5 mm pristine · 5–25 mm fine on modern machines
  · 25–50 mm sags — hidden undersides only · >50 mm add internal ribs or supports.
  Long shallow custom curves/fillets under a surface: keep ≤30° from horizontal or they
  need support.
- Walls: ≥ 2× nozzle (0.8 mm); make wall thickness a multiple of line width (0.8/1.2/1.6)
  to avoid gap-fill. Vertical pins ≥ Ø5 mm or they snap — use steel dowels below that.
- Text/detail (single-color engrave/emboss): stroke 0.5–1 mm wide; engraved 0.5–1 mm
  deep; embossed 0.5–0.75 mm tall, never >1 mm (sags). Multi-color inlay strokes need
  ≥0.8 mm (§6). Surface textures ≥0.4 mm wide (nozzle width); knurling 0.5 mm wide /
  0.5 mm spacing.
- Slicer manipulation: a 0.2–2 mm wide slot or disc cut through a region forces the
  slicer to build solid perimeter walls there — free local reinforcement around holes,
  bosses, and rods without touching infill settings.
- Vertical holes: 1 mm fillet on the top edge = screw funnel + stops top-layer pull-out.
- Vents: 45° slats as thin as 0.5 mm; overlap + stair-step the slats to block water
  splash while passing air.
- Holes print undersized: +0.3–0.5 mm on Ø2–3, +0.2–0.4 on Ø3–8, +0.2–0.3 on Ø8–12.
  Oversize in CAD or use slicer X-Y hole compensation (0.05 PLA / 0.1 PETG-ABS);
  drill/ream critical bores. §4 fit clearances are ON TOP of this correction for mating
  bores — apply hole compensation first, then the fit clearance; don't confuse the two.
- Bed-contact edges: 45° chamfer 0.2–0.4 mm (beats slicer elephant-foot compensation).
  Chamfer horizontal/overhanging edges; fillet only vertical edges. Never fillet into the
  bed plane (creates a near-0° overhang).
- Horizontal holes: teardrop (to ~Ø4) or flat-roof/diamond with +0.4 mm above nominal.
- Vase mode: one continuous contour per Z, no islands/holes; line width 150–200% of nozzle.

## 2. Orientation & strength

- Across-layer (Z) strength ≈ 55–67% of in-plane; design as if half. Never load a
  cantilever root, screw boss, or snap arm across layers.
- Orientation decision order: (1) big flat face on bed, (2) overhangs minimized/designed
  out, (3) layers aligned with load, (4) cosmetic faces up/outward — never on supports,
  (5) seam on a hidden or sharp edge, (6) multi-color layers as low as possible.
  Conflicts? Split the part (dovetails or pins + glue), each half in its ideal orientation.
- One-piece boxes/enclosures: print **diagonally on an edge at 45°** (lids/trays ~35°)
  — box+lid pairs instead get a diagonal parting line, §9. Diagonal printing kills
  supports, layer lines loop through every wall (no single splitting plane — flat-printed
  parts are up to 3× stronger along layers), uniform finish on all faces. Flatten a
  small land on the down edge for bed adhesion.
- Strength budget: perimeters >> infill. Structural default: 4 walls, 5 top/bottom,
  30–40% gyroid (near-isotropic). >50% infill is wasted; add walls instead.
- FDM cost ≈ surface area, not volume: thick voluminous parts beat thin-walled/ribbed
  ones (weight-saving cutouts often ADD time and material). Don't model internal
  cavities — let honeycomb infill lightweight it; modeled thin shells put layer seams
  at stress concentrations.

## 3. Designing out supports

- Put 45° chamfers under every boss, counterbore, and side protrusion.
- Sacrificial bridge: roof a counterbore with one bridged layer, drill/punch after; leave
  0.4 mm droop clearance under any bridged roof that matters.
- Model break-away tabs with a 0.2 mm (1-layer) gap where a slicer support would scar.
- Designed bed helpers, exact numbers: raft 1 mm thick; brim 0.2 mm (one layer);
  tie-down struts 1 mm wide; one-layer "velcro" connection points 0.4–0.5 mm. Large flat
  first layers: warp-relief checkerboard cuts 1 mm deep spaced ~25 mm apart.
- Internal steps: widening-upward needs nothing; narrowing-upward creates internal bridges
  — flip the part or chamfer the transition.
- Prefer a designed bridge (or a 1-layer sacrificial floor punched out after) over any
  support — span limits per §1.
- When support is unavoidable, **model it in CAD** so every print is identical: triangular
  fins parallel to the overhang, body 0.5–1 mm off the part, connected by 0.5 mm snap
  prongs; ~0.2 mm top gap, 0.2–0.3 bottom; 45° the fins themselves; wide base; chamfer
  so they break away by hand. "Thumbtack" pin supports stabilize tall diagonal parts.
  Cut holes through sacrificial blocks (crush to remove) and emboss "SUPPORT" on them.
  Trick: generate tree supports in a slicer's SLA mode, export STL, place in CAD.

## 4. Fits & tolerances (per-side clearance — store per-side values in Params cells / PARAMETERS variables)

- Press: 0.0–0.1 mm · snug: 0.1–0.2 · sliding: 0.15–0.3 · loose: 0.3–0.5 ·
  free rotation: 0.4–0.7. PETG/ABS want +0.05 over PLA. Mating parts from another
  printer: 0.5. (Diametral = 2× these.)
- Press-fit insurance: 3–4 crush ribs 0.2 mm proud inside a +0.4 mm bore — ribs deform
  plastically, bore doesn't crack — but **single assembly only** (refit force collapses).
  For repeated assembly use **grip fins** (thin elastic fins that flex, not crush):
  fin ID 1 mm under the rod diameter (11 mm ID grips a 12 mm rod), 0.3 mm clearance gap
  behind each fin — constant grip that also absorbs shrinkage.
  Hex/square bores tolerate interference better than round.
- Alignment: **diamond pins** — square pins rotated 45° in diamond holes — self-center
  and print sideways with zero overhang sag (round pins print oval on their side).
  Panel edge-joins: curved **spring T-slots** that compress on insertion.
- Compliance beats precision: a fit tuned on one printer/material won't transfer. Build
  in flex — slot behind a wall so it springs (gap 0.3–0.5 mm), chamfer mating lid edges
  so parts wedge over a range, cut away box corners (least accurate region, where fits
  bind). Assume ±0.1 mm per surface; single-layer features run undersized.
- Tight or unknown fit → print a coupon first: ladder of holes/pegs stepped
  0 / 0.1 / 0.15 / 0.2 / 0.3 / 0.4 mm. Ten minutes of printing saves the real part.
- Snap fits: taper the arm toward the tip, base fillet ≥ 0.5× thickness, deflect only
  during assembly, print the arm lying in the layer plane. PETG/ABS/PA — PLA arms shatter.
- Threads: model ≥ M8 (≥1/8") vertical with 0.15–0.3 mm radial clearance, trapezoidal
  profile, thread features 2–4 mm; horizontal threaded holes: cut away the top and
  bottom arcs of the thread (sag zones) — the sidewall threads alone grip the screw.
  Below M8 use heat-set inserts — M6–M8 either works, inserts win for repeated assembly
  — (hole Ø4.1–4.3 for M3, blind hole +1 mm, 1–2 mm solid
  plastic around the hole, iron ~10–20°C above print temp) or captive nuts (pocket
  +0.1–0.2 mm, pause-and-insert, bridge over) — a flanged nut dropped in mid-print with
  plastic grown over it is pull-out-proof.

## 5. Print-in-place & moving parts

- Gaps: 0.3 mm minimum between PIP features; 0.4–0.6 for free-spinning axles/hinges;
  vertical gaps ≥ 2 layers (0.4 mm). First motion "cracks" the joint free — keep contact
  area small.
- Living hinges (materials canon: mechanisms.md §1): PP/TPU for real cycle life;
  PETG/PA survive a few gentle cycles; PLA never.
  Web 0.2–0.5 mm × 3–6 mm span, filleted, printed flat on the bed — never bridged.
- Compliant mechanisms: keep flexure strain low and add hard stops limiting travel.

  [mechanisms.md](mechanisms.md).

## 6. Multi-color / multi-material

- **Waste economics**: single-nozzle AMS purges on every swap (dark→light ≈ 3× light→dark;
  a 12 g model can make 70 g waste). Prime tower height = last color-change layer, so
  concentrate color in few, contiguous, **low** layers. Dual-nozzle (X2D/H2D): ~zero purge
  between two materials; >2 colors still purge within a nozzle group.
- **Face-down graphics**: mirror text/logo into the bottom face, colors in layers 1–3 —
  minimal purge, razor-sharp boundaries, uniform plate finish. Guard with elephant-foot
  compensation ≥ 0.15 so thin strokes don't bleed. This also shrinks the prime tower.
- **Flush inlays**: cut the recess and the inlay from the same sketch, zero clearance
  (same-layer extrusions fuse); 0.4–0.6 mm deep (2–3 layers) hides the base color; stroke
  width ≥ 0.8–1.0 mm, bold sans fonts. Export as one 3MF via scripts/make_3mf.py.
- **Free color tricks**: color-change-at-Z (pause/M600) gives per-band color with zero
  purge and no AMS; engrave-and-paint-fill or a sticker recess when only one filament.
- **Bonding matrix**: same polymer = welds. Welds well: ABS↔ASA, PETG↔TPU, ABS/ASA↔TPU,
  PETG↔ABS. Separates cleanly (use as support interface or avoid as structure):
  PLA↔PETG, PLA↔ASA/ABS, TPU↔PLA, PA↔almost everything. Co-printed colors must share a
  polymer family or be mechanically interlocked (dovetails, through-holes, captive geometry).
- Mixed-material jobs share one bed/chamber: don't pair PLA with ABS/ASA (bed 60 vs 95 °C,
  chamber heat-creeps PLA); PLA+PETG at ~60–65 °C is the workable odd couple.

## 7. Material by environment

| Material | HDT/Tg | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| PLA/PLA+ | ~57/60 °C | Creeps under load at room temp; fades in UV. Prototypes, fit tests |
| PETG | ~69/80 °C | Easy, tough, decent UV; top-rack dishwasher risky |
| ABS | ~87/105 °C | Yellows in UV; acetone-weldable/smoothable |
| ASA | ~100 °C | Outdoor + car-interior default; acetone-weldable |
| PC | ~117/147 °C | Boiling-water capable; hygroscopic |
| PA/PA-CF | HDT 190–205 °C | Strongest; absorbs water, bonds to nothing |
| TPU | flex, −30…+80 °C | Grips/gaskets/feet; soft grades need external spool |

Parked car in sun (cabin 60–80 °C, dash to 105 °C): ASA/ABS/PC only — PLA fails, PETG
marginal. Outdoors year-round: ASA. Always propose the PLA fit-test before printing the
final in engineering material.

## 8. Finishing tricks

- Fuzzy skin hides layer lines and adds grip; ironing smooths top faces (~10–15% flow).
  Better: model texture in CAD (knurl, crosshatch, noise) — travels with the file,
  free in FDM (vs tooling cost in molding). Avoid raised details thinner than the nozzle.
- Seams distort round walls up to 0.4 mm and protrude into holes — give the slicer a
  sharp concave corner (≥120°) to hide the seam in, or align to a hidden edge. Vertical
  holes: a 120° teardrop corner does the same job.
- Warping: CAD-modeled mouse-ear tabs (0.2–0.4 mm discs) release cleaner than brim;
  rounded outer contours warp less than sharp corners.
- Shrinkage scaling: ABS ~0.4–0.8%, ASA ~0.6%, PLA ~0.2–0.3% — or measure a test cube.
- Annealing PLA (100 °C/45 min): heat resistance jumps, strength barely, dimensions shift
  up to 10% — rarely worth it vs printing ASA.
- Gluing: CA for PLA/PETG/ABS; epoxy for gaps/dissimilar; acetone welds ABS/ASA
  near-monolithic; PP/TPU need roughening + specialty adhesives.

## 9. Production rules (print-farm wisdom — cheap insurance on any print)

- **Design slicer-agnostic**: every functional feature lives in CAD, never in slicer
  settings — the part must print right at any layer height, infill, or machine.
- First layer: as close to a circle as possible — no sharp corners, no text, minimal
  area on the bed face; sharp first-layer corners are the #1 warp/curl failure. Slightly
  recess (bow) large bottom faces to cut contact area.
- Chamfer the bottom perimeter ≥1 mm on production parts (machine-independent
  elephant-foot immunity); 0.2–0.4 mm where the dimension is critical.
- Round/fillet every vertical edge ≥1 mm: the nozzle never decelerates into corners →
  faster, stronger, more accurate, less ringing. Inner corners: chamfers stair-step
  predictably. Replace thin flat mounting tabs with chunky monolithic tabs grown from
  the body, chamfered underneath.
- Enclosures: cut the box/lid parting line diagonally so both halves print belly-down
  supportless; square lids with cut-out corners wedge tight on the flat walls; grip fins
  hold lids at constant pressure; quarter-turn lids = nub + channel <2 mm deep (or
  chamfered); sliding latches = print-in-place spring with ~2 mm travel. Hide any box
  inside an organic shell by boolean-cutting the cavity + standoffs into it; integrate
  DIN-rail / extrusion / strap mounts directly into the body.
- Batch tricks: group parts on a 1 mm raft (whole batch ejects as one), connect
  multi-part assemblies with snip-sprues so they ship assembled, stand large panels on
  edge held by thin fins.
- Invisible extras: text/logo/barcode embedded 0.5–1 mm under the surface reads only
  when backlit. Internal glue channels: assemble dry, inject glue at one port, channels
  route it everywhere — doubles as internal rebar.
- Fillet every feature-to-body transition — sharp inside corners are where FDM cracks.
- Text: ≥3 mm tall (stroke/depth floors in §1); deboss beats raised; cleanest on
  vertical faces; never on the bed layer.
- Zip-tie channels: ~4.8 OD / 3.2 ID tube sections, perpendicular to layers.
- Shadow lines: deliberate 0.5–1.5 mm gaps between mating shells hide fit imperfections.
- Zero post-processing target: no supports, no bed-face cleanup, textures hiding layer
  lines — every human touch multiplies cost at volume.

## 10. Domes, curves & rotors

- Domes: make them egg-shaped/oblong (steeper overhang) or keep the outside spherical
  and cut the inside to a cone — the sag is always internal. If support is needed, a
  designed internal "mushroom" 0.5 mm below the arch apex, or flatten the interior apex
  so slicer supports get a clean pop-off target.
- Spheres: cut a flat base at 60° tangent; or lift on a disc + fat 1 mm pin; star-pattern
  fin supports offset 0.2 mm beat solid cylinders (airflow → no thermal shrink lines).
- Shallow top curves stair-step: drop to 0.1 mm layers, or facet the curve deliberately,
  or pixelate it in 1 mm steps as an aesthetic, or hide it under noise/knurl/concentric
  rings; a domed lid with a flat edge chamfer can print on its side instead.
- Vase mode: prismatic folds/creases for rigidity; never a flat roof — slot the ceiling
  so the path stays one continuous outline.
- Propellers/fans: hub flat on bed, blade pitch >45° (shallower → designed vertical
  supports 0.3 mm off, twist away); a thin ring joining blade tips = permanent support;
  serrated/micro-blade leading edges are free in FDM.
- Rings with clips: best printed on their side on an octagonal outer flat; clips at 45°
  to the bed so they don't align with the weak layer plane; bottom clips moved to touch
  the bed need no support.

# 3D Print Engineer

## Charter

Own the printer, material, orientation, **fit strategy**, slicing process, coupons, and
failed-print forensics. Engage before design so DFM is a design input, and after verification
so accepted geometry has an executable physical test plan. Do not redesign geometry or waive
verification.

## Inputs and outputs

- Pre-design inputs: `dimensions.md`, functional/load/environment requirements, available
  machines/nozzles/materials, and reference acceptance.
- Pre-design output: `print_plan.md` using the exact template in
  [`../team-design.md`](../team-design.md#print_planmd).
- Post-verification inputs: passing `verification_report.md`, final exports, and
  `print_notes.md`.
- Post-verification outputs: finalized `print_notes.md`, coupon source/export when
  fit-critical, slicing notes/profile, print order, inspection and field-test protocol, and
  failed-print evidence when applicable. Summarize the gate in `final_print_prep.md`.

## Checklist

### Pre-design

1. Select printer, material, nozzle(s), layer height range, and single/dual-nozzle envelope.
2. Set the planned orientation from loads, mating surfaces, visible faces, bridges,
   overhangs, supports, and anisotropy. Record an exact model-to-printer transform, named
   bed-contact landmark at Z=0, bed normal, insertion/open direction, and forbidden
   downward faces.
3. State minimum walls, pins, holes, gaps, embossed/debossed features, tolerance/shrink
   allowances, and load-path rules tied to the planned nozzle/material/profile.
4. **Own the fit strategy, declared per interface.** Derive it from the metrologist's
   as-observed mating geometry and stated measurement uncertainty in `dimensions.md` — the
   metrologist records geometry, not clearance. For every mating/contact interface, declare in
   `print_plan.md`: interface ID; fit type (`clearance`, `transition`, `interference`,
   intended elastic contact, crush rib, snap engagement, retention, seal, thread, or compliant
   mechanism); intended contact state; an allowed interference/clearance range with an explicit
   min **and** max per side (never an open-ended floor); motion path (state `none` for a fixed
   interface); material assumptions; a coupon/calibration requirement; and a numeric/physical
   acceptance method. **No universal zero-interference rule** — an interference, crush-rib,
   snap, or retention interface may declare a deliberately negative (intersecting) range; a
   `clearance` interface must stay non-negative on both sides. Over-clearance (slop, wobble, a
   captured part that slips or rattles) is a failure mode exactly like interference; every
   range needs its upper bound too.
5. Set the support budget and forbidden support-contact faces; require bed-facing
   elephant-foot chamfers where fit geometry approaches the plate. Classify each printability
   rule as `SELF_SUPPORT_REQUIRED` or `SUPPORT_ALLOWED`, and freeze its `required_now`,
   `deferred_owner`, and `final_gate` fields before candidate design.
   **Support-free is the default, not an absolute.** Never require `SELF_SUPPORT_REQUIRED`
   where meeting it forces a *functional* surface — a mating wall, a fit face, a bearing/grip
   face — into a distorting gable, steep taper, or over-wide cavity. When self-supporting would
   compromise function or fit, plan a **bounded `SUPPORT_ALLOWED`** on a *nonfunctional* region
   instead: function and fit win over support-purity. Reserve zero-support absolutism for parts
   where a support-free orientation costs nothing functional.
   **Set the downward-surface screen threshold with a small margin past 45°.** The screen
   (`team_preflight.py`) flags faces whose transformed normal is below `downward_normal_z_max`;
   an *intended* self-supporting 45° chamfer (bed elephant-foot, self-support ramp) tessellates
   to just past `-cos(45°) = -0.70710678` and is then falsely flagged as an overhang (observed on
   the Pixel, Garmin, and broom bed chamfers). Set the threshold a touch **more negative** than
   `-0.7071` — about `-0.73` (`-sin(47°)`), flagging only overhangs steeper than ~47° — so an
   exact-45° self-supporting chamfer (whose facets tessellate to 45.0–46°) clears. Validated on the
   broom clip: out-of-limit 17.6 → 0.0 mm² at `-0.73`. Equivalently, require the designer to make
   intended self-supporting chamfers a couple degrees **less overhanging** than 45° (e.g. 42°), not
   sitting exactly on the boundary. The screen is a conservative orientation check, not a
   supportability proof.
6. Define multi-colour/body/nozzle constraints and purge/contamination risks.
7. Define the fit coupon region and pass/fail measurements for every interface that declared a
   coupon/calibration requirement, before the designer begins. Default to one multi-lane
   coupon STL; add files only for physically disjoint interfaces.
8. Record assumptions and approval state in `print_plan.md`; unresolved manufacturing
   blockers stop candidate design.
9. Write `print_plan_checks.json` as the exact machine-readable projection of every plan
   Edge ID, support rule, and declared interface. The Markdown and JSON ID sets, transforms,
   thresholds, and dispositions must agree before candidate dispatch.

### Post-verification

1. Confirm the verification report passes the same `print_plan.md` version and final exports.
2. Produce the actual mating-region coupon first for fit-critical parts; default coupon
   material is PLA only when it does not invalidate shrink/thermal behavior.
3. Give slicer/profile, orientation, supports, brims, seam, wall/top/bottom, infill,
   temperature/drying, colour/nozzle assignment, and export/import notes.
4. For every `SUPPORT_ALLOWED` footprint, produce the plan-required native slicer project,
   underside contact-selection view, section/toolpath view per failing interval, and
   footprint-to-contact/layer map. Confirm transform, material, nozzle, layer, line width,
   gap, and interface settings. Support-free plans with zero out-of-limit regions do not
   need a native project solely for ceremony.
5. Write `final_print_prep.md`: use `COMPLETE` only when no deferred visual review remains,
   or `READY_FOR_REVIEW` when support/contact/toolpath evidence needs verifier review.
6. If plan-required native slicer evidence cannot be produced, write
   `BLOCKED_NATIVE_SLICER` with command/version, candidate and plan hashes, missing
   capability, and required action. A `NON_NATIVE` fallback stays blocked without explicit
   user approval.
7. State print order and dimensional/visual inspection after the coupon and final print.
8. Define field-test procedure, acceptance thresholds, safety limits, and rollback.
9. For failure forensics, preserve photos/settings/measurements, identify whether truth,
   geometry, material, slicing, or machine owns the failure, and route to that contract.
